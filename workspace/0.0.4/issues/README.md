# 0.0.4 — Land all seven — issue slices

Fine-grained slices of [../PRD.md](../PRD.md) (7 tracks: API-only workbench,
durable Postgres job queue, TS cleanup, real integrations, integrations ops
surface, eval completion, metrics instrumentation). Each slice is
independently implementable and reviewable, names its own acceptance, and
carries the **three-layer gate** (0.0.3 convention): ① technical ② browser
E2E ③ owner PAC — with the pure-refactor carve-out where named.

**Numbering is iteration-scoped** (0.0.4 S-numbers). Precondition satisfied:
0.0.3 merged to main (PR #56, 2026-07-21).

## Dependency graph

```
T2 queue:  S01 queue core (+ADR) ─▶ S02 turn worker cutover ─▶ S03 outbound idempotency
           S01 ─▶ S04 background worker + trigger migration
           S03 ─▶ S05 dead-letter view + replay
T3 dead:   S06 zero-ref TS deletion   [independent — can land first]
T1 api:    S07 shared constants → packages/shared     S08 server-side account bootstrap
           S07 + S08 ─▶ S09 API-only cutover (delete stores/stubs + test migration)
           S02 + S04 + S09 ─▶ S10 one-command dev orchestration
T3 tail:   S07 + S09 ─▶ S11 delete domain-adapters + eval-runner (+API-only ADR)
T4 integ:  S12 Composio pin+cutover ─▶ S13 get_ar_summary real
           S14 EasyRoutes direct driver   [parallel to S12]
T5 ops:    S12 + S14 + S09 ─▶ S15 integrations status page ─▶ S17 reconnect (+integrations ADR)
           S04 + S15 ─▶ S16 scheduled health probes
T6 eval:   S10 ─▶ S25 CI harness topology (gap-review add)
           S02 + S25 ─▶ S18 live harness ─▶ S19 email suite in CI (also needs S25)
           S18 ─▶ S20 judge advisory wiring (+live-eval ADR)
T7 meas:   S21 event counters   [independent]
           S04 + S20 ─▶ S22 honored-rate job      S20 ─▶ S23 quality-gates live
Final:     S24 product UAT + PAC sign-off (after ALL incl. S25)
```

Recurring-schedule note (gap-review fix T1): no cron exists anywhere — S01
delivers the periodic-enqueue mechanism (`(type, window)` dedupe ticks), S04
runs the tick loop, and S16/S22 plus the retention cadence consume it.

Execution order (grilled decision 19): **S01–S11 (substrate) → T4 → T5 →
T6 → T7 → S24.** Within the substrate: S01→S05 (queue) ‖ S06/S07/S08 first,
then S09 → S10/S11. S12/S14/S21 are parallel-safe anytime after their deps.
